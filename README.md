Basically, anything that is inserted in the search form will be passed through the cragislist statis URL. Any result that appears on that page are stored into a list. This list is shown in another page which serves the user the available option. Each option contains a link which is directing user to the particular craigslist page upon clicking.

The requirement list is provided in the file called 'requirement.txt'
